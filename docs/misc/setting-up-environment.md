# Setting Up an Environment

How to set up an environment to get started with `soundworks`.

## Install Node.js

### Mac OSX

1. Open [https://nodejs.org/en/](`https://nodejs.org/en/`) in your favorite browser (which shall not be Safari).
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version.
3. Follow the instructions... 
4. When done, open a Terminal (cf. `Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`) and type:

```
node -v
```

Press "Return" and you should see:

```
v12.16.1
```

(...or whatever Node.js version you just installed)

5. Done!

::: tip Tip
To deal with several versions of Node.js in a easy way, you can install the `n` package globally on your machine, cf. [https://www.npmjs.com/package/n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n).

```
npm install -g n
```
 
Check package documentation to learn how to avoid using `sudo`

## Install a Text Editor

Pick a text editor of your choice, popular text editor nowadays seems to be
- Sublime Text 3 - [download](https://sublimetext.com/3) - _tells you from time to time that it would be nice to buy a license, but that's all_
- VSCode - [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - _probably a good idea if your are on windows_
- Atom - [download](https://atom.io/)
